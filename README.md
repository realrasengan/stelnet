# stelnet
### Make a SSL secured telnet connection to a host/port

## Background
I like to use telnet to login to IRC servers and check various outputs, but it's insecure.

## Installation
Make sure you have nodejs/npm installed and then copy stelnet to a bin folder of somekind in your path.

## Usage
```
stelnet example.com 6697
```

## Enter stelnet
This is just a simple nodeJS stdin script that uses the tls default module with nodejs.
